Title: "Shareholding network of financial institutions: a dynamic analysis"
Abstract: |
  Over the last decade interconnectedness has become key to characterize the
  financial system and to analyze phenomena that can jeopardize its stability.
  Financial institutions are involved in many transactions like lending and
  borrowing contracts, syndicated loans, international capital flows and
  cross-holdings to list a few. All these transactions create complex linkages
  among them
  which, in case of downfall of an institution, can result in bad
  outcomes for the real economy as materialized in the recent financial crisis.
  Therefore to strengthen policy interventions, tools from the network
  literature are used to study the architecture of financial systems. We
  contribute to this ongoing debate by analyzing the topology of
  cross-shareholding network of financial institutions (banks, insurance
  companies, broker-dealers etc.). For this we exploit portfolio holdings data
  of 82 large financial institutions located in United States and Europe over
  the period 2006-2012. We are able to study the changes in the network
  structure through time and thus complement common works on static interbank
  networks. Furthermore we use network based measures to quantify the level of
  integration and diversification of each financial institutions. Integration
  refer to the level of exposure of financial institutions to each other and the
  diversification captures how the cross-shareholding is spread out. Our results
  show that as time passes the cross-shareholding network becomes dense and
  exhibit a scale free property. In addition some financial institutions tend to
  keep their levels of integration and diversification stable while for others
  those factors decrease mainly after the financial crisis in 2008. These
  findings offer new insights on the systemical importance of financial
  institutions.
