Title: Econometric Models of Network Formation
Abstract: |
   This talk will survey some of my recent work on the econometrics of
   network formation. Particular attention will be given to methods which
   admit unobserved agent-level heterogeneity and/or allow for
   interdependencies in preferences for link formation. Issues of
   identification, as well as methods of large network inference, will be
   emphasized.
