Title: The Belgian Production Network
Abstract: |
     This presentation covers the overview of a large economic research agenda
     on firms and production networks in Belgium. Using data on
     enterprise-to-enterprise transactions for the universe of Belgian
     enterprises between 2002 and 2014, combined with a myriad of
     enterprise-level databases, we present several ongoing projects in this
     agenda. We start with the description of the production network and its
     characteristics in both cross-sections and dynamics. Then, we turn to the
     impact of idiosyncratic productivity shocks to individual firms on the
     aggregate of an economy. We show that idiosyncratic shocks can propagate
     through the network and generate volatility in GDP in the same order of
     magnitude as observed GDP. Moreover, only a handful of firms (0.15% or the
     top 100 firms) contributes to over 90% of the volatility generated by the
     model. In a related project, we analyse the impact of productivity shocks
     channeled through imports. In another project centered on international
     trade, we show that the distance to exports correlates with firm-level
     productivity. One project looks at the supplier-buyer network from a
     bilateral perspective and revisits the old question why firms are big.
     Using a model-based decomposition, we show that 80% of the variation in
     firm sizes is generated by inter-firm demand. Moreover, the extensive
     margin (number of suppliers/customers) contributes most to the variation
     on both the supply side and the demand side. Finally, a last project looks
     at the geographical constellation of production clusters. We show that
     there are 6 large clusters in Belgium that are both geographically and
     sectorally concentrated.
