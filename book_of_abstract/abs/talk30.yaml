Title: SIS Epidemics and the Direction of Information Flow in Brain Networks
Abstract: |
   The  interplay  between  structural  connections  and  emerging
   information flow in the  human brain remains an  open research problem.  A
   recent study observed global patterns  of directional information flow  in
   empirical data using the measure of transfer entropy. For higher frequency
   bands, the overall  direction of  information flow was  from posterior  to
   anterior regions whereas an anterior-to-posterior pattern was observed  in
   lower frequency bands.  In this study,  we applied a  simple SIS  epidemic
   spreading model  on  the human  connectome  with  the aim  to  reveal  the
   topological properties of the structural  network that give rise to  these
   global patterns.
   In order to quantify the information flow between regions, we computed the
   transfer entropy  values  for all  node  pairs evaluating  different  time
   windows. We  found  that  direct  structural  connections  induced  higher
   transfer entropy  between  two brain  regions  and that  transfer  entropy
   decreased with increasing distance between nodes (in terms of hops in  the
   structural network). Applying the SIS model,  we were able to confirm  the
   empirically observed opposite information flow patterns, which seem to  be
   linked to different time scales  of the spreading process. Posterior  hubs
   in the structural network  appear to play a  dominant role in the  network
   dynamics  since  the  global  pattern  of  information  flow  is  in   the
   posterior-to-anterior direction when these hubs are strong senders, and in
   the opposite  direction  when  they are  strong  receivers.  Our  analysis
   suggests that these  global patterns of  directional information flow  are
   the result of  an unequal  spatial distribution of  the structural  degree
   between posterior and anterior regions.
