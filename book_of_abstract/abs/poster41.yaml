Title: Power Networks --- A network approach to voting theory
Abstract: |
     In this paper I study elections where the preferences of the voters are
     derived from their position in the social network. I argue that in some
     cases studying the ideology of the electorate is not the right way to
     understand the result of an election. In small electorates or in
     committees the personal connections can be much more important than
     political ideology. I develop a voting model where these personal
     connections add up to a social network and I study what network properties
     and the social structures lead to a voting equilibrium. I show that single
     peaked preferences on chain and tree networks are inherent in my model,
     then I define a set of networks where the equilibrium is robust to changes
     in the intensity of a connection. Finally I provide a method to locate
     potential Condorcet winners in the network. In the discussion I relate my
     approach to the practice of using centrality measures (betweenness or
     eigenvector centrality) in the analysis and in an illustrative example I
     calibrate my model to predict the victory of the Medici family in a
     medieval power struggle.
