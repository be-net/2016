<p>Many problems related to graphs and networks, like for instance
multiscale community detection or visualization, can be solved by using
the so-called combinatorial Laplacian. Various diffusion processes on
networks are generated by a series of normalized combinatorial
Laplacians, providing efficient tools in many applications. Recently,
several deformations of this discrete Laplacian have been used for
solving a variety of problems in applied mathematics; some important
examples are the signed Laplacian and the connection Laplacian.
Within this context, we propose a class of deformed Laplacians and
discuss their properties in view of applications. Among all the options,
a possible deformation is the dilation Laplacian whose least eigenvector
(i.e., the one of the smallest eigenvalue) can be used to rank objects
from &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; pairwise comparisons; in this problem, the objects are the
nodes of a graph and the comparisons are the directed edges. The nodes
may for instance represent currencies and the edges may be associated to
exchange rates. While still using the dilation Laplacian, we can compute
a ranking of players in sport tournaments, where cyclic inconsistencies
in the comparisons may arise.
Another type of deformed Laplacian is the magnetic Laplacian, which is
complex valued and Hermitian. The least eigenvectors of the magnetic
Laplacian, called the magnetic eigenmaps, can be used in order to
visualize directed networks and to uncover certain types of community
structures in directed graphs.
In this talk, an overview of the construction of such deformed
Laplacians will be given in the light of certain analogies with physical
systems. Several illustrations of potential applications will be outlined.</p>
